## Amazon Inventory Management DB ##

this project was built as a test for webapp application using very small DB for web interface framework. 

these are few endpoints which could be helpful while we build applications

http://127.0.0.1:8080/ - Redirects to default API in views.py

http://127.0.0.1:8080/inventory/getlist - Lists all the Amazon Inventory Management Systems in the DB

Further API, required for the projects will be added and continue to build website ..
